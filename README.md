## Create the NeedIt Application and Application Files

### ServiceNow's powerful platform allows developers to create cloud-native applications to rapidly add value to their organization.

Access a comprehensive set of platform services such as **data management, workflows, templates, scripting tools, and integrations** that allow you to rapidly develop and deploy Web standards-based service management applications for every department in the enterprise.

**Consumerize your users’ experiences via consistent and intuitive user interfaces, self-service portals, and service catalogs.**

Discover and prioritize business-enabling opportunities with **built-in platform analytics and reporting,** to assess business operations.

**Meet stringent Security and Governance Standards** by building and deploying your applications and data on a proven platform that runs **24x7 operations and security monitoring** to ensure your instances are protected and operating as intended.

Achieve a **cost-saving multiplier effect** with every new application deployed on a single system of record by leveraging a single extensible platform and integrated data model.

### ServiceNow is ideal for building business applications that:

```

  Replace processes managed in spreadsheets and email.

  Modernize and improve departmental applications built on legacy platforms.

  Automate processes, particularly those with a request-fulfill pattern.

```

### Designing an Application


**At a minimum, plan the following:**

```
Business Logic
User Interface (UI)
Data Model

Business Logic
Be able to clearly state the business problem to be solved and the desired outcomes. For example, the business problem statement(s) may start with:

We need to track...
We need to automate...
We need to respond...
Your outcome statement(s) may start with:

We can save...
We can retire...
We can improve...
Be able to list all stakeholders for your application. Use this information to design user personas which are important when applying security to an application.

Clearly define the business process that will be part of the application. List the required steps, stakeholders, data sources, and outputs/visualizations.

User Interface
Decide what User Interfaces (UIs) you will use within your application. 
Decide if the application is for desktop and tablet only, or if users can access the application from a smartphone.

Data Model
Define the table structure the application will use as well as the relationships between the tables. Typically tables are the first artifact added to an application. Changing the data model during the application development process can cause extensive re-working of an application's logic.

```

### ServiceNow Studio

```
Studio is ServiceNow’s Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and is the preferred interface for building and modifying applications. It provides easy navigation to all files within your application, contains a tabbed interface, and offers many convenient features, such as keyboard shortcuts, code search, and more:

Create and edit applications
Create application files
Determine which application files comprise an application
Link applications to a GitHub source code repository
Publish applications to the ServiceNow application repository
Submit applications to the ServiceNow App Store

```
